<p>TweetSeeker is an app to help you find those tweets that are a pain to find otherwise. If you know the screenname of the user 
and approximately when they said it, then we can help you quickly narrow down the tweets you have to look at.</p>

<p>TweetSeeker grabs the most recent 3200 tweets from a user, and then allows you to dynamically specify the date range that you're
interested in.</p>

{% if user %}
<p>If you're ready to try it out, place the twitter ID of the user you're interested in exploring the search box above, and hit <strong>Seek.</strong></p>
{% else %}
<p>Although TweetSeeker supports use by unauthenticated users, we highly recommend you <a href="/login">login</a> have a consistent experience.
This is due to Twitter's rate limiting restrictions. Without logging in, the system might stop unexpectedly.</p>
